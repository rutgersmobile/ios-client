Discussion About Git Workflow :

	Currently the most stable branch is 4.2-exp-2
	This was created from 4.2-exp	
	4.2-exp has the atheletics implementations
	4.2-exp-2 was created due to errors when I tried to keep both xcode 7 and xcode 8.

	For now branch everything off of 4.2-exp-2. 
	I will remove the banner feature which we will not be releasing when all the different features branches 
	have been merged into 4.2-exp-2.

	4.2-bus-redesign was merged into 4.2-exp-2 as it has a few code changes for the beta release
		The bus has not been redesigned, that will be done in the near future
